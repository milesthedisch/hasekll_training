-- Ths function looks a bit useless.
-- but there is actually usefullness
-- that comes out of this function.
-- The usefullnes comes from saving key strokes.
-- Inheritly f x y is ((f x) y)
-- but when using the $ it will do the opposite. 
-- f $ x y = (f (x y))


-- ($) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b  
-- f $ x = f x  

-- Examples:
-- sum $ map sqrt [1..1000]
-- sqrt $ 3 + 4 + 5
-- sum (filter (>10) (map (*2) [2..10]))
-- sum $ filter (>10) (map (*2) [2..10])
-- sum $ filter (>10) $ map (*2) [2..10]
-- map ($ 3) [(4+), (10*), (^2), sqrt]

-- In mathematics, function composition is defined like this: (f â—¦ g)(x) = f(g(x)).

-- Negate all number in the list.
-- I dont think this will work.

-- (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c

-- we can use currying and write the function like f . g . z    (x is curried!)

-- map (\x -> negate (abs x)) [5,-3,-6,7,-3,2,-19,24]
-- map (negate . abs) [5,-3,-6,7,-3,2,-19,24]

-- zip the two lists: 
-- Which applys the max against [1, 2] in the first iteration.
-- That will equal 2 
-- After all interations we will get
