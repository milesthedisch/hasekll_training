# hasekll_training

  Little haskell training bits.
  Im using the following two resources to get my self a haskell education.

## Why?

  The primary focus of this repo is purely personal. It is a place to keep a  diary of my haskell learnings. 

## Code 

  All code will be commented and executed to make sure it works. 
  There will examples that differ from the books for a test of my memory.

## Resources 

  The primary resource of the material is from [learnyouahaskell](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com) and [standfords intro to haskell](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures/01-intro.html). 

===

### Learnyouahaskell :: [*Chapter 1*](./chapter_1)

  The first Chapter seems to be pretty basic and just talks how to get started on haskell.

### Learnyouahaskell :: [*Chapter 2*](./chapter_2)

  The second chapter starts to get into code, the basics of haskell and some common functions. 

  It ends of list comprehensions which seem a bit weird to me coming from a JS background, but I think I just need to play around a bit more with it.

### Learnyouahaskell :: [*Chapter 3*](./chapter_2)

  Chapter 3 is really explaining what types and type class's are. There is not much to actually do but just read most of the chapter.

### Learnyouahaskell :: [*Chapter 4*](./chapter_3)

  Chapter 4 dives into more of the function syntax. Cases, pattern matching, let, and where. I like this chapter cause its start to get more into the coding.

### Learnyouahaskell :: [*Chapter 5*](./chapter_4)

#### [Recursion](./chapter_4/recursion.hs) 

  Im familiar with recursion but have always found it a little bit difficult. Haskell seems to use recusive functions a lot, because in Haskell there are no loops; loops like we have in Java and Javascript and C++. This is going to be a mind shift...
