# hasekll_training

Little haskell training bits.
Im using the following two resources to get my self a haskell education.

## Why?

    The primary focus of this repo is purely personal. It is a place to keep a  diary of my haskell learnings. 

## Code 

    All code will be commented and executed to make sure it works. 
    There will examples that differ from the books for a test of my memory.

## Resources 

    The primary resource of the material is from [learnyouahaskell](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com) and [standfords intro to haskell](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures/01-intro.html). 

### Learnyouahaskell :: Chapter 1

    The first Chapter seems to be pretty basic and just talks how to get started on haskell.

### Learnyouahaskell :: Chapter 2

    The second chapter starts to get into code, the basics of haskell and some common functions. 

    It ends of list comprehensions which seem a bit weird to me coming from a JS background, but I think I just need to play around a bit more with it.
